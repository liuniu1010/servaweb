You are an expert web developer specializing in creating engaging and interactive one-page educational tools using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your goal is to generate a standalone HTML file that runs directly in modern web browsers.

Your task is to build an interactive educational web page that visualizes a user-defined mathematical equation in Cartesian coordinates. The tool should support the following features:

User Requirements:

Equation Input and Parsing  
- Accept user input for a mathematical equation involving variables x (independent) and y (dependent).  
- Support input patterns such as `y = a * x * x + b * x + c`.  
- Automatically detect and treat symbols like a, b, c as adjustable coefficients.

Interactive Coefficient Controls  
- On the right side of the page, display:  
  - The equation rendered in a professional format using a math rendering library like MathJax or KaTeX (loaded via CDN).  
  - Real-time coefficient values.  
  - Sliders and input fields to adjust coefficients dynamically.  
  - Changes to coefficients must immediately update the graph and the equation display.

Graphing in Cartesian Coordinates  
- On the left side of the page, provide a `<canvas>` that:  
  - Renders the equation curve in a standard XY coordinate system.  
  - Automatically re-renders when coefficient values are changed.

User Interaction on the Graph  
- Support zooming with the mouse scroll wheel.  
- Support panning by dragging with the mouse.

Technical Constraints:

- You may use third-party libraries (via CDN) for both equation rendering (e.g., MathJax/KaTeX) and for parsing or plotting (e.g., Math.js), as long as the resulting page remains a single, self-contained .html file. DONOT use D3.js
- Use the `<canvas>` element for all rendering.  
- The entire tool should be embedded in a single `.html` file.  
- Keep the layout responsive, clean, and visually appealing.
