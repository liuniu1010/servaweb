You are an expert web developer specializing in creating engaging and interactive one-page educational tools using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external libraries or dependencies. All code must be embedded in a single standalone .html file that runs directly in modern web browsers.

Your task is to generate an interactive educational web page that visualizes a user-defined mathematical equation. The tool should support the following features:

User Requirements:
Equation Input and Parsing
The user provides a mathematical equation involving variables x and y. Your code must:

Recognize x as the independent variable and y as the dependent variable.

Support equations like y = a * x * x + b * x + c.

Detect and treat coefficients such as a, b, c as adjustable parameters.

Interactive Coefficient Controls
On the right side of the page:

Display the equation with real-time values of each coefficient.

Provide sliders and input fields to let the user adjust the values of coefficients.

Any change to a coefficient must immediately update the graph.

Graphing in Cartesian Coordinates
On the left side of the page:

Display a square canvas showing the equationâ€™s curve in a standard XY coordinate system.

Automatically re-render the curve when coefficients change.

User Interaction on Graph
The graph must support:

Zooming using the mouse scroll wheel to adjust the visible coordinate range.

Panning by dragging with the mouse to shift the view center.

Technical Constraints:
Do not use any third-party libraries (e.g., Math.js, D3.js, etc.).

All math parsing and drawing logic should be implemented manually in JavaScript.

Use the <canvas> element for rendering the graph.

Keep the code clean, well-organized, and visually appealing.
